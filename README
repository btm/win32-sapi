== Description
   This is a Ruby interface to the Microsoft Speech API, 5.x.
	
== Prerequisites
   The Microsoft Speech API 5.x. It can be downloaded for free from 
   http://www.microsoft.com/speech.
   
== Installation
   gem install win32-sapi
   
== Synopsis
   require 'win32/sapi5'
   include Win32
	
   v = SpVoice.new
   v.Speak("Shall we play a game?")
	
== Notes
   This module is a simple interface to the Microsoft Speech API 5.x.  There
   are interfaces to all of the Automation classes that this API consists of.
   Each class is a subclass of the SAPI5 class, which is in turn a subclass
   of WIN32OLE. With your object you can then call the available methods for
   that particular Automation class.

   This documentation won't offer the complete documentation for every method.
   Instead, download the Microsoft Speech API 5.x documentation (a .chm file)
   and read the part that covers 'Automation'.
